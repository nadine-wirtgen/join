  <h2>How to use it</h2>

<br>
  <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use  <span class="join-highlight">Join</span>:</p>

<br>
  <ol class="help-steps">
    <li>
      <span class="step-number"></span>
      <p>
        <strong>Exploring the Board</strong><br />
        When you log in to <span class="join-highlight">Join</span>, you'll find
        a default board. This board represents your project and contains four
        default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="step-number"></span>
      <p>
        <strong>Creating Contacts</strong><br />
        In <span class="join-highlight">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
        collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
        "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
        contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
        the board.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="step-number"></span>
      <p>
        <strong>Adding Cards</strong><br />
        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
        represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
        list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
        task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="step-number"></span>
      <p>
        <strong>Moving Cards</strong><br />
        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
        board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="step-number"></span>
      <p>
        <strong>Deleting Cards</strong><br />
        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
        delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
        Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
        irreversible.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Remember that using <span class="join-highlight">Join</span> effectively
    requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
    reflects the current state of your project.
